## Simplified Percentage Fees for VectorBT

VectorBT's `fees` parameter is a percentage applied to both buy and sell turnover. We convert the total round-trip cost into an equivalent per-side percentage.

### US Stocks - IBKR Pro Fixed

Total all-in cost for a $10,000 trade (100 shares × $100):
- Commission: $0.005 × 100 = $0.50 → min $1.00
- SEC fee (sell only): $10,000 × 0.000008 = $0.08
- FINRA TAF (sell only): 100 × $0.000195 = $0.02
- Round trip: $1.00 (buy) + $1.00 (sell) + $0.08 + $0.02 = $2.10
- Per side: ~0.01% of trade value

```python
# US Stocks (IBKR Pro Fixed): ~0.01% fees + $1 fixed per order
fees = 0.0001            # 0.01% per side (SEC + FINRA regulatory)
fixed_fees = 1.0         # $1 minimum commission per order

pf = vbt.Portfolio.from_signals(
    close, entries, exits,
    fees=fees,
    fixed_fees=fixed_fees,
    init_cash=100_000,    # $100K USD
    freq="1D",
    min_size=1,

fees = 0.00001           # ~0.001% per side (SEC + FINRA only)
fixed_fees = 0           # No commission

pf = vbt.Portfolio.from_signals(

#   Commission: $0.65, Exchange: ~$0.30, OCC: $0.02, Regulatory: ~$0.01
#   Total: ~$0.98 per contract = ~0.2% of notional
fees = 0.002             # ~0.2% per side (exchange + clearing + regulatory)
fixed_fees = 0.65        # $0.65 per contract commission

## Data Source for US Markets

Use `yfinance` for US market data:

```python
import yfinance as yf

# US Stocks
df = yf.download("AAPL", start="2022-01-01", end="2025-01-01", interval="1d")

# US ETFs
df = yf.download("SPY", start="2022-01-01", end="2025-01-01", interval="1d")

# Benchmark: S&P 500
benchmark = yf.download("^GSPC", start="2022-01-01", end="2025-01-01", interval="1d")
# or use SPY ETF as benchmark
```

## Best Practices

- For US stock backtests with IBKR Pro, the $1 minimum commission dominates costs for small trades
- For large trades (>200 shares of $100+ stocks), per-share commission becomes significant
- IBKR Lite is effectively commission-free for stocks but still has regulatory fees
- US futures costs are extremely low as a percentage of notional - ideal for high-frequency strategies
- Options costs are relatively high as a percentage of premium - factor this into spread strategies
- When in doubt, use IBKR Pro Fixed pricing as a conservative baseline
- Always use `min_size=1, size_granularity=1` for stocks to avoid fractional shares
- Default US benchmark: S&P 500 via `^GSPC` (index) or `SPY` (ETF) from yfinance
